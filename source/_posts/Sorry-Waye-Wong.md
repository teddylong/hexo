Expo 2010… Waye’s dream, break by me, totally.  Caused by my fault, the ticket can’t be transformed in time… so sorry to you, Waye! This is not the important thing which seen by other guys, but for me, it means I have not enough ability to handle two or more things at one time, one thing perfect, one thing go to hell… Think deeply, the root reason is lazy~ So this is not the blog entity for Wang, but for my-self, warning me, if could, I wish it lasts the whole life.
