From quiet hometown to this “debauch” city, from 2008 to 2009, everything seems like before, no car, no house, no money in bank… Who buy me a drank? I have no money pay for the Whisky.

I tried so hard, can’t seem to get away from misery. GOD i tried so hard, but always be a victim of this society. It ain’t my fault cause i try to run away but trouble follows me. And still i try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me. But until then i will be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow, trust me…

First, let me explain that i am just a small beer, came from the infertile town, so i am having a hard time stayin’ on track man. My mind be racin and i don’t even know what i am chasin’ yet. Been in and out of relationships, i’m starting to see that it’s me where the complications at. Sometimes i thought i was right but really i’m wrong and again i was too blind to see…
I was in the fast lane, chasing my dreams, and then it seems like when the fame and cash came, it just got me going crazy, but finally i’ve been in so many collisions by fucking money and authority.

It is like i’m taking five steps forward and ten steps back. Tryin’ to get ahead of the game but i can’t seem to get it on track, and i keep running away from the ones that say they protect me the most…

Lord would you help me? And keep this pain away from my family. I see that things won’t change, i am stuck in this game, as soon as get out it keeps pulling me back. You know, the game today they play, there contains more than sixty percents of I put in. But if you fall off then it’s all on you. Try so hard but i won’t pull through…

I flying the first class, up in the sky…
