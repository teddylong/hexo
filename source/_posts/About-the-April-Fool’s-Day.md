See, what I got in the April Fool’s Day! Or should I be proud of this? Because the letter is from Steve Ballmer (CEO of Microsoft)…

It seems every year I got the different types of this “surprise”. Hot girls’ dating, winning the lottery ticket, even the exam passing! (I’m sure this is the most Fuc*ing joke in my life.) Feel happy? Feel sad? Feel helpless? Yeah, this is the truly life. Happy, sad, that means you are alive! Most time we are doing is complaining, you are sad like a dog, and relieving in the left time, you are happy like a dog. Maybe you want to say this is called “wasting time”, but as long time like this, you may know something about life, actually whatever happened, life is life, as long as you are alive, soooo what?

Never got too much money, never been quite satisfied… That is the real life…
