Working outside is a long and arduous journey. While most people see the glamorous side of being a “business trip” man. Few understand the sweat and pain that go into it. To make the journey bearable, you really need the backing and support of a great team. And for this, I am indeed fortunate and blessed to have one. This thinking was born when  I first went out for the job. Especially, I want to thank my leader Cindy and Jennifer, Thanks for believing me! Now this whole big project is almost completed, I hope I have not disappointed you.

I also want to express my heartfelt thanks to Jong(Architect) and Tessa(PM). Both of them have provided me with tremendous guidance throughout my journey and like a good compass, they have continually steered me in the right direction. There were times where I simply wasn’t sticking to my schedule, but with a firm and steady hand they held on to me and made sure I would cross the finishing line. Thank you, Jong and Tessa!

I also want to thank my mom and my family. Without your pretty warm hearts, I can’t image how bad taste that was. I wish I can be your son next lifetime…

Last, but no least, thanks to all the hardworking Microsoft folks working behind this project. Although I didn’t have a chance to interact with you directly, I am appreciative of all of your hard work, Thank you!
